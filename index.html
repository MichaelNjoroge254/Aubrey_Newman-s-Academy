                <p>Aubrey newman's has been more than a school to me...it has moulded me to the person I am today, an electrical engineer. It has equipped me with the relevant skills I require to face the world.Apart from being one of the top student in 2018 national academic excellence, Aubrey Newman gave me computer skills which has helped me in my engineering drawing.It also made me a sports person, a footballer, an athlete and a chess player, winning tornaments.Aubrey Newman's is the place to be.</p>

                <p>Aubrey newman's is the school that you enroll your child not just for certifications, but to build a career foundation in an ever-evolving world. While a student here, I learnt a tonne of things that I would not have readily learned elsewhere. Personal skills such as communication and how to teach yourself to learn. It became more than just a school to me, it became a community that I wanted to be a part of and wanted to grow. Today I'm a software Engineer because Aubrey Newman's gave me a firm foundation. </p>
